### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What are important differences between Python and JavaScript?
Python uses spaces and indents for blocks of code while javascript uses braces, and python has a lot more expansive libraries like flask and django.
Python focuses on back-end development, but javascript can also do front end by interacting with html and css.

- Given a dictionary like ``{"a": 1, "b": 2}``: , list two ways you
  can try to get a missing key (like "c") *without* your programming
  crashing.
 code: get(key,val) on an if statement, and if false: print a message saying key not found, or setdefault(key,val), and if not true- set it to a 
 standard default value: dictionary_hurricane("no cyclone", "storm system not found")

- What is a unit test?
Unit tests test one section of code such as a single class or function.

- What is an integration test?
Integration tests test over multiple classes, functions, methods, or files.

- What is the role of web application framework, like Flask?
Flask connects the python code to javascript, html, css, for front end web page building

- You can pass information to Flask either as a parameter in a route URL
  (like '/foods/pretzel') or using a URL query param (like
  'foods?type=pretzel'). How might you choose which one is a better fit
  for an application?
  You must define the route first for the route URL way, and then for the param- the parameter is passed to type variable so you don't have to define the route 
  first.

- How do you collect data from a URL placeholder parameter using Flask?
Use app.route in the Flask App, and a def function: 
@app.route('/hurricanes/<list>')
    def get_hurricane_list(list):

- How do you collect data from the query string using Flask?
Use request.args.get("data")

- How do you collect data from the body of the request using Flask?
from flask import request, then use a post request

- What is a cookie and what kinds of things are they commonly used for?
text files holding data sent between client and server

- What is the session object in Flask?
Sessions are erased unlike cookies at the end of a browser session, but store key/value data in dictionary

- What does Flask's `jsonify()` do?
Allows you to respond to the page in json form: 
from flask import jsonify
@app.route('/get_hurricane_list')
def get_hurricane_list():
	return jsonify(cyclone_name=cyclone.cyclone_name, max_wind=cyclone.max_wind, category=cyclone.hurricane_category)
